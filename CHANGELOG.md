# Change Log

All notable changes to the "salesforce-metadata-deployer" extension will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.3] - 2025-09-10

### Added
- **Sub-component Grouping**: Custom object components (fields, validation rules, list views, etc.) are now grouped under their respective categories within each custom object
- **Improved Tree Organization**: Enhanced hierarchical structure with intermediate group nodes for better visual organization

### Enhanced
- **Package.xml Generation**: Custom object sub-components now correctly include parent object names (e.g., `Trade_Deal__c.ActualRevenueCurrentFY__c`)
- **Tree View Structure**: Better organization with expandable groups for CustomField, ValidationRule, ListView, WebLink, RecordType, CompactLayout, and BusinessProcess

### Fixed
- **TypeScript Warnings**: Resolved unused variable warnings in metadata utilities
- **Bundle Component Processing**: Fixed processing of Aura and Lightning Web Component bundles

## [1.1.2] - 2025-09-10

### Fixed
- **Package.xml Generation**: Critical fix for metadata parsing that was causing incorrect package.xml entries with full file paths instead of proper component names and metadata types
- **Metadata Type Detection**: Restored sophisticated parsing logic that correctly identifies custom fields, validation rules, and other custom object components as separate metadata types
- **Component Name Extraction**: Fixed extraction of clean component names from subfolders (e.g., `controllers/MyClass` now correctly becomes `MyClass` in package.xml)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-09-10

### Added
- üîç **Auto-Expanding Search**: Tree sections automatically expand when they contain matching search results
- **Search Highlighting**: Matching search terms are visually highlighted in yellow for easy identification
- **Smart Search Animation**: Matched items fade in with smooth animations for better visual feedback

### Improved
- **Search UX**: Enhanced filtering logic that traverses the entire tree hierarchy to find and expose matches
- **Multi-level Expansion**: Parent nodes automatically open to reveal child matches at any depth
- **State Restoration**: Clean restoration of original tree state when search is cleared

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-09

### Added
- üå≤ **Tree View Interface**: Metadata is now organized hierarchically with expandable/collapsible nodes

- **Real-time Package.xml Preview**: Live preview of generated package.xml as you select components
- **Parent-Child Selection**: Selecting a parent object automatically selects all its children
- **Multi-level Select All**: "Select All" functionality at metadata group and parent object levels

### Fixed
- **Metadata Type Mapping**: Fixed incorrect categorization of custom object sub-components (fields, validation rules, etc.)
- **Subfolder Support**: Correctly handles classes and other components organized in subfolders (now extracts just the class name, not the full path)
- **Package.xml Generation**: Ensures proper metadata type names and component references

### Changed
- **UI Layout**: Redesigned interface with tree view and split-pane layout for better usability
- **Filtering**: Enhanced search functionality that works across the hierarchical tree structure
- **Selection Model**: Improved checkbox behavior with parent-child relationships
